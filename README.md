# 📘 DAA Practice Problems

This repository contains all my practice problems and solutions for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** subject. It includes a variety of problems covering core algorithmic techniques, complete with explanations and code implementations.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Brute Force Techniques
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, etc.)
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- NP-Completeness (basics)
- Recurrence Relations & Master Theorem

## 🗂️ Structure

The problems are organized into folders by topic:

```

/brute-force/

* problem1.cpp
* problem2.py
  /divide-and-conquer/
* merge\_sort.cpp
* binary\_search.py
  /greedy/
* activity\_selection.cpp
  ...

````

Each problem includes:

- ✅ Problem statement (in comments or separate `.md` file)
- 💡 Approach and time complexity
- 💻 Code implementation (in C++ / Python / Java)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/daa-practice.git
   cd daa-practice
````

2. Browse problems by topic.

3. Run code:

   * For C++: `g++ file.cpp -o file && ./file`
   * For Python: `python file.py`
   * For Java: `javac File.java && java File`
